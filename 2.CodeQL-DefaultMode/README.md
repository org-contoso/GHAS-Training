# CodeQL-Intro

This course will guide you through the basics of CodeQL, including setting up your environment, running your first queries, and understanding CodeQL analysis results.

## Instructions
Follow the steps in the official GitHub Skills course: [Introduction to CodeQL](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-codeql).

You can do this in your personal repos as public repos because CodeQL code scanning, Copilot Autofix and GitHub Actions is free for public repos.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Instead of doing Step 2 Activity 5, just create a blank issue to progress to Step 3.**
